ok so 

this is the auth plan

like how we auth users

3 tables

1. Tasks table
  a. id (int)
  b. Tasks
  c. list id
  d. taskNum
2. List table
  a. id (text)
  c. userID (from the Credentials table)
3. Credentials table
  a. id (text)
  b. username
  c. password (encrypted)

when user wants to add something right

we check token and stuff

then we check the list the user is trying to change

and if list allow user

sure we add
